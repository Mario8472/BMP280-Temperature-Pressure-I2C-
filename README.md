# BMP280-Temperature-Pressure-I2C-
BMP280 Temperature &amp; Pressure with I2C communication

PROJECT: BMP280 Temperature & Pressure (I2C)
MCU: STM32F072RBT6
DEV. BORD: STM32F072B-DISCO
SENSOR: Bosh BMP280
IDE: MDK-ARM Keil uVision
AUTHOR: Mario OletiÄ‡

Project description:
This project uses I2C communication to obtain temperature and pressure data from the BMP280 sensor. The obtained data were then subsequently processed and formatted to be sent to the PC via UART communication, in order to be visible to the end user.
